# Arduino Code Usage

The code located in the arduinofiles folder is code that was used to test individual components of the board as well as the final code that integrated all of the components and was the main program that ran on the board for the demo. To run the code, you must place the source files into the same directory as your Arduino library files. Trying to run the code from this directory after pulling will not work.

The demo_V3 is the code that was used for the final demo. All other files are included for completeness and were used for intermediate testing.
